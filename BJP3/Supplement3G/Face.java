/*


Suppose you have the following existing program called Face that uses the DrawingPanel to draw a face figure. Modify the program to draw the graphical output shown below. Do so by writing a parameterized static method that draws a face at different positions. The window size should be changed to 320 x 180 pixels, and the two faces' top-left corners are at (10, 30) and (150, 50).
Java DrawingPanel close maximize minimize
expected output
(46, 180)

(You don't need to include any import statements at the top of your program.) (The next exercise is a modified version of this program, so you can use the code you write here as a starting point for that exercise.)

import java.awt.*;

public class Face {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DrawingPanel panel = new DrawingPanel(320, 180);
        Graphics g = panel.getGraphics();

	drawFace(g, 10, 30);
	drawFace(g, 150, 50);
    }
    public static void drawFace(Graphics g, int x, int y) {
	g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
        g.drawOval(x, y, 100, 100);   // face outline

        g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
        g.fillOval(x+20, y+30, 20, 20);     // eyes
        g.fillOval(x+60, y+30, 20, 20);

        g.setColor(Color.RED);          // mouth
