/*
 Write a method called printNumbers that accepts a maximum number as a parameter and prints each number from 1 up to that maximum, inclusive, boxed by square brackets. For example, consider the following calls:

printNumbers(15);
printNumbers(5);

These calls should produce the following output:

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]

You may assume that the value passed to printNumbers is 1 or greater.
