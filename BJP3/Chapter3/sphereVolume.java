/*

Write a method called sphereVolume that accepts a radius (a real number) as a parameter and returns the volume of a sphere with that radius. For example, the call sphereVolume(2.0) should return 33.510321638291124. The formula for the volume of a sphere with radius r is the following:

volume = 4/3 Ï€ r3

public static double sphereVolume(double radius) {
    return(4.0/3 * Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 3));
}
