/*


Modify your MickeyBox program from the previous exercise into a new class MickeyBox2 so that the figure is drawn by a method called drawFigure. The method should accept three parameters: the Graphics g of the DrawingPanel on which to draw, and two ints specifying the (x, y) position of the top-left corner of the figure. Use the following heading for your method

public static void drawFigure(Graphics g, int x, int y)

Set your DrawingPanel's size to 450 x 150 pixels, and use your drawFigure method to place two figures on it. One figure should be at position (50, 25) and the other should be at position (250, 45).
