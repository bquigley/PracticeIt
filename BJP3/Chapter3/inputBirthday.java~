/*

Write a method called inputBirthday that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and prompts the user to enter a month, day, and year of birth, then prints the birthdate in a suitable format. Here is an example dialogue with the user:

On what day of the month were you born? 8
What is the name of the month in which you were born? May
During what year were you born? 1981
You were born on May 8, 1981. You're mighty old!


*/

public static void inputBirthday(Scanner console) {
    //    Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("On what day of the month were you born? ");
    int day = console.nextInt();
    System.out.print("What is the name of the month in which you were born? ");
    String month = console.nextLine();
    System.out.print("During what year were you born? ");
    int year = console.nextInt();
    System.out.println("You were born on " + month + " " + day + ", " + year +
		       ". You're mighty old!");
