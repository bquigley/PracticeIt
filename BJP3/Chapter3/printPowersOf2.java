/* Write a method called printPowersOf2 that accepts a maximum number as an argument and prints each power of 2 from 20 (1) up to that maximum power, inclusive. For example, consider the following calls:

printPowersOf2(3);
printPowersOf2(10);

These calls should produce the following output:

1 2 4 8
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

You may assume that the value passed to printPowersOf2 is 0 or greater. (The Math class may help you with this problem. If you use it, you may need to cast its results from double to int so that you don't see a .0 after each number in your output. Also, can you write this program without using the Math class?)

public class printPowersOf2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

	    System.out.print((int) Math.pow(2, i) + " ");

	System.out.println();
