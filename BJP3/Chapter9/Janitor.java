/*


Write a class Janitor to accompany the other law firm classes described in this chapter. Janitors work twice as many hours per week as other employees (80 hours/week), they make $30,000 ($10,000 less than general employees), they get half as much vacation as other employees (only 5 days), and they have an additional method clean that prints "Workin' for the man." Make sure to interact with the superclass as appropriate.
