Write a method called triangleArea that accepts the three side lengths of a triangle (all real numbers) as parameters and returns the area of a triangle with those side lengths. For example, the call triangleArea(8, 5.2, 7.1) should return 18.151176098258745. To compute the area, use Heron's formula, which states that the area of a triangle whose three sides have lengths a, b, and c, is the following. The formula is based on the computed value s, a length equal to half the perimeter of the triangle:

area = âˆš (s (s-a)(s-b)(s-c))
where s = (a + b + c) / 2
*/

public static double triangleArea(double a, double b, double c) {
    double s = (a+b+c)/2;
    return(Math.sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)));
}
